# NightCloud üåô‚òÅÔ∏è
**NightCloud** is a resource-sharing platform that turns underutilized personal devices into a distributed cloud infrastructure. This system allows users to contribute their idle devices (overnight or during downtime) to run containerized workloads securely while enabling others to use compute resources in a community-driven cloud environment.

- **Containerized Task Execution**: Secure task execution using containerization (Podman/Docker) for resource isolation.
- **Web Dashboard**: A simple interface to manage, monitor, and retrieve task outputs.
- **Client Contribution**: CLI tool for contributors to share their device's resources.
- **Task Output Retrieval**: Automatically captures output (e.g., logs, files) and saves them for requesters.
